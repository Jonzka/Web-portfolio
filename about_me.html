                    <h2>About me</h2>
                    <p>I easily get along with all different kinds of people from different backgrounds,
                        and I work well in teams. I did martial arts for seven years in my teenage years, toward the end of which
                        I assisted in teaching juniors. I learn new things fairly quickly, and in my work
                        prefer to get things done rather than laze around.</p>

                    <h2>Education and work</h2>
                    <p>I graduated from junior high in 2019, and went on to study in upper secondary right after.
                        I completed my matriculation exams in upper secondary in 2022 with an average of
                        M. I then took half a year to work at a storage and delayed going to
                        university of applied sciences, because my service in the Finnish
                        defense forces started in January 2023.</p>
                    <p> After completing my service in June 2023 I had a summer break
                        and started my studies in JAMK.</p>
                    <p>During summer breaks in upper secondary, I worked at a small local renovation
                        company. It was very physical work, and mostly involved cleaning places
                        and carrying heavy objects.</p>

                <section class="contentRight">
                    <h2>Free time</h2>
                    <p>During my free time I like to play video games, read books, bike and play
                        various board- and tabletop roleplaying games.</p>
                    <p>Computers have interested me since I was a child. My first computer ran on
                        Linux Fedora, although once I got an interest in computer games I had to switch to Windows.
                        There's many things for me to still learn, and that's why I'm in JAMK!</p>
