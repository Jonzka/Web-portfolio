                    <p>In school I had a python basics course. We learned about loops, file-and error handling,
                        text handling, modules, classes and dictionaries in simple programs.</p>
                    <p>For my final project in this course I made a Dungeons and Dragons character
                        builder.</p>

                    <p>My first computer was a Linux fedora, although I asked for my dad's help
                        to do almost anything because I was a kid and didn't know much.</p>
                    <p>More recently I've set up my own webserver with Linux, and learned a lot
                        from the Linux basics course in JAMK. I know text-editing, how to set up
                        services and timers, file-handling, permissions, users and groups
                        and package management.</p>

                    <p>This page is all done by hand with HTML and CSS. The basics course in JAMK
                        taught us a bunch of the basic HTML elements, inline vs block elements, CSS styles and
                        how to use classes and IDs.</p>
                    <p>This portfolio was the final project for the HTML course.</p>
